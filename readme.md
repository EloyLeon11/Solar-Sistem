----------------------------------- MUSIC --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---- PROGRESS ---- 

1. I HAVE MANAGED TO PLAY THE MUSIC AND MAKE THE MUSIC MUTE BUTTON

2. MAKE THE MUTE BUTTON PRETTIER AND PUT IT IN SOME MORE COMFORTABLE POSITION?



 --- ISSUES ----

 1. THE MUSIC IS HEARD VERY LOUD FROM THE POINT OF POSITION AND AS I GET AWAY THE VOLUME IS LOWER. I WANT MUSIC TO BE HEARD THE SAME EVERYWHERE
 

 2. WHEN I START DIRECTLY FROM THE MOBILE, THE MUSIC DOES NOT WORK, I THINKIT'S BECAUSE OF THE AUTOPLAY, I HAVE TO MAKE A START BUTTON.
